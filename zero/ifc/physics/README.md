# The Physics library

This module contains types to reflect the natural physical measurement units, types, operations...
along as provides a whole set of algorithms and functions that computes and solves problems in the
domain field of physics.

Another interesting thing is how we are able to relate the types between them, once they are strong types,
and how they are convertible ones to others if that makes sense in the real world, how we force them
to implement custom behavior, explicit conversions... how they can for expressions and how can be related...
